### MRM - Alerts

Alerts in the MRM allow you to define any number of rules to show your employees potentially problematic or good-to-know information, such as bad addresses or fraudulent accounts.

Alerts can be customized in a few different ways, but are mostly static to fit with the theme of the MRM.

See the below links to learn how to create, modify and use alerts in the MRM.
