Once clicked, the "Verify Address" dialog box will open and attempt to verify the address.

If the address is unable to be verified, the dialog box will display an error message.

If the address was able to be found, an USPS verified address will be displayed on the right hand side of the dialog box. Click "Set Adjusted Address" to apply the address to the name fields.
